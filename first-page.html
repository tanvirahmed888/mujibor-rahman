            Born on March 17, 1920, in the quaint village of Tungipara in Gopalganj, Bengal (then part of British India), Sheikh Mujibur Rahmanâ€™s early life was deeply influenced by the socio-political environment of his time. His passion for politics emerged during his school years, where he became actively involved in the All India Muslim Students Federation in 1940.
